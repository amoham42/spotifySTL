# SpotifySTL
Create a 3D-printable keychain featuring the Spotify code of your favorite song.

Step 1:
Get the main URL of the song from Spotify, and paste it in the textbox on the top right corner. 
Step 2:
Export the STL file and import it in any 3D printing software. Make sure to change the filament color after 2mm printed, not before.
If you do not have a 3D printer or want to send the file to be printed, I recommend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q7YO5svZtY&pp=ygURc3RhcnQgM2QgcHJpbnRpbmc%3D.
